                    <h2>Kedarkantha- Mountain changed my life</h2>
                    <p>Starting from Mussoorie, this rather short four-day trek covering roughly 30 km, is in the heart of the Govind Pashu Vihar National Park & Sanctuary in Uttarakhand. So, sure the trek starts from Sankri, but reaching Sankri from Mussoorie is quite the trek itself, albeit by vehicle. Reach Mussoorie at 7 am and your journey starts. The road takes you along Vikashnagar, Kempty falls and also will be a stone’s throw from Yamuna bridge. A note for the tourist-trekker as this route takes you along Kempty falls, there is no need to plan an additional visit here! Time saved is time gained. You will reach Jurmola, which is your last mobile connectivity point! A beautiful winding road great for photography opens up thereafter, though the treacherous mountain paths can cause motion sickness. You reach Sankri base camp in the evening. Remember, it is an active wildlife sanctuary, so all along you are advised to get back to base by evening.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="moreblog1">
                        <p>Having reached Sankri, the next day is for orientation, training and the acclimatization walk. Visit the unique Shivji temple where the village keeps all the sports shields and cups that it has won – a humble obeisance to the deity. Its unique architecture is a draw in itself. The Sankri base – camp is a delight, especially come Christmas and New Year when it is festooned with gay décor to set the mood. Take care when you walk up and down the slippery steps, after snowfall or rainfall. The YHAI volunteers are known to keep a naughty count of the participants who have a nasty fall here!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The next morning you set out to Juda Talav. A rather easy forested walk with a tea spot and a lunch canteen in between, you might even encounter the batch coming down along the way! An hour after lunch, the magnificent Juda Talav in all its winter wonder invites you. Take care to heed the instructions as stepping on the frozen Talav is an accident, waiting to happen. As long as your eye can see, you can see this beautiful stretch of white sheet – pure bliss, dotted with trees. This is what makes Kedarkantha such a do-able trek – while you are walking in the extreme cold and snow, the presence of the tree-line is assuring!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The summit day starts before the crack of dawn so you get to enjoy the sunrise at the summit. The night skies slowly opening themselves to wake you up will be a scene forever etched in your memory (and will make you come here, again). As the sky changes colour, the beauty of the surroundings becomes evident and strikes your heart. This is why you braved the snow, the random fall, the loss of breath, why you came up to 12500 ft’. Time seems to pass by quickly and as you descend down, you realise how windy it is, more so due to the disappearing tree-line. This chill can be nasty and fast. You will come down via the shadow route to Luhasu for much-needed hot lunch and return to Argaon camp.</p>

                    <h2>Valley of Flowers- Landscape filled with colors</h2>
                    <p>Known for its meadows of endemic alpine flowers, Valley of Flowers is located in the ‘Abode of
                        God’, Uttarakhand in Chamoli District of the Garhwal region. Be it nature lovers, mountaineers
                        or botanists, a walk to this striking UNESCO World Heritage Site is an apt choice to enjoy the
                        eponymous Himalayan valley, which is replete with rich biodiversity and breathtaking
                        surroundings. While trekking to this sublime beauty, you will pass through an off-beat trail,
                        isolated hamlets, abandoned areas and diverse species of flora and fauna, which is an experience
                        of a lifetime. Perched at an altitude of 4,389 m, the valley is home to endangered animals,
                        including the brown bear, blue sheep, Asiatic black bear and snow leopard.Being one of those rare natural botanical gardens in the country, a trek to this floral city
                        is known for evoking an unfathomable elation in the mind of trekkers. </p>
                    <div class="moreblog2">
                        <p> When one of my friends,who is an ardent trekker, asked me to accompany her to the Valley of Flowers, I
                            quickly signed up without any second thought. Next day, we began our journey at 4 am.
                            Traveling via Dehradun brought back so many fond travel memories for me. We soon reached
                            Haridwar, which is the starting point of the Valley of Flowers trek.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Along the way, do not miss
                            an opportunity to witness the holy confluence of Bhagirathi and Alaknanda Rivers that
                            together form the River Ganges. Though it’s a long journey, the path is fascinating when one
                            notices the stunning convergence of these two rivers. It is likely that you may get tired,
                            therefore, it is advised to take a short break and relax in a gorgeous apple orchard on the
                            way.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>After some rest, it was time for us to move from the base camp Govindghat to Ghangaria. The
                            first day of Valley Of Flowers trek began with a 14 km gradual ascent from Govindghat to
                            Ghangaria. The beauty of a number of waterfalls and lush greenery hypnotized us. In
                            addition, the villagers told us that the world’s highest Gurudwara and the most revered of
                            all Sikh Shrines, the ‘Hemkund Sahib’, is situated nearby, at an altitude of 4,329 meters.
                            Ghangaria is a base camp for the Valley Of Flowers trek, and people can avail different
                            services that include hiring a mule or using a helicopter. We had booked rooms at Garhwal
                            Mandal Vikas Nigam, which is considered as the best place to stay in Ghangaria.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Next day after having some scrumptious Aloo Paranthas, we started a trek through Ghangaria to
                            Valley of Flowers. The most difficult thing during the trek was to face heavy winds, but it
                            was heartening to see that trekkers were helping each other to move ahead comfortably. As we
                            scaled a height of 3,858 m to arrive at the Valley of Flowers, we witnessed thousands of
                            flowers in full bloom. Our eyes were glazed by a fantastic and beautiful sight. At the
                            starting point of this national park, I came across the Balsam flowers that sported bright
                            light pink, blue and orange colors, followed by Himalayan Slender Tape Vine, Meadow Rue,
                            Dwarf Globe Flower, and Marsh Marigold. The majesty of ‘Brahma Kamal’ (Saussurea obvallata)
                            too was evident among the cluster of white and black Daisy flowers. It took around four
                            hours to admire the rare and exotic beauty of the flowers spread like a blanket sheet,
                            stretched over an expanse of 87.50 km. A unique blend of snow-capped mountains, green
                            meadows, and white clouds made our trek a dreamlike adventure.</p>
